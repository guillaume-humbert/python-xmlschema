Description: XML Schema validator and data conversion library for Python
 This library arises from the needs of a solid Python layer for processing XML
 Schema based files for MaX (Materials design at the Exascale) European
 project. A significant problem is the encoding and the decoding of the XML
 data files produced by different simulation software. Another important
 requirement is the XML data validation, in order to put the produced data
 under control. The lack of a suitable alternative for Python in the
 schema-based decoding of XML data has led to build this library. Obviously
 this library can be useful for other cases related to XML Schema based
 processing, not only for the original scope.
